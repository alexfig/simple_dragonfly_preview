# Dragonfly Image Preview

Easily add an image with preview to your forms. This will make your forms submit faster and allow the user to get feedback on how the image will look like. Oh, and you can skip the `multipart` attribute in your forms!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:
```ruby
gem 'simple_form'
gem 'dragonfly'

gem 'simple_dragonfly_preview'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle


## Usage

```ruby
f.input :avatar, as: :image_preview, size: "145x145#"
```

### Strong Parameters
You'll also need to update your form's controller. For example, assuming a `User` model with an `avatar_uid` field, you'd need:
```ruby
User.new(params.require!(:users).permit(:retained_avatar, :remove_avatar, ... ))
```

### Default Image
You can change the default image by running a configuration block (in rails, you would place this in a file inside the config/initializers directory:
```ruby
SimpleDragonflyPreview.configure do |config|
  config.default_image_url = "lorem.png"
end
```
